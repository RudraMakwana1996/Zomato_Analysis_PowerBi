# Project Objectives
Analyze the geographical distribution of restaurants in different cities.
Identify the most popular cuisines in each region.
Study the correlation between restaurant ratings and cost for two.
Examine the density of high-rated restaurants by location.
Provide an interactive Power BI dashboard for better understanding of restaurant trends.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Zomato Restaurant Dataset. It includes details of over 9,000 restaurants in India.

# Data Cleaning and Transformation
Before visualizing, the dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query in Power BI:
Missing Values: Handled null values in important columns (e.g., Rating, Cost for Two).
Data Type Conversion: Ensured proper data types for numeric fields like cost and rating.
Geographical Mapping: Used location data to map restaurants geographically.

# Key Visualizations
The following visualizations are included in the Power BI dashboard:
1.Restaurant Distribution Map: A map showcasing the geographical spread of restaurants across different cities.
2.Cuisine Popularity: Bar chart showing the most popular cuisines based on restaurant count.
3.Ratings vs. Cost for Two: Scatter plot showing the relationship between customer ratings and average cost for two.
4.Top Rated Restaurants: Filtered list and table of the highest-rated restaurants in each city.
5.City-wise Analysis: A breakdown of the number of restaurants, average ratings, and average cost for two by city.
